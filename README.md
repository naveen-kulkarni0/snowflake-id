# SNOWFLAKE-ID-GENERATOR
Twitter's snowflake is an amazing way to generate monotonically increasing unique ids within a system without
any external dependencies or external moving component and will work beautifully in a distributed system.
The snowflake id is a 64bit id consisting of the below sequence

| reserved/sign bit | Timestamp (ts) | Node ID | Sequence Number (seq) |
|-------------------|----------------|---------|-----------------------|
| 1 bit             | 41 bits        | 10 bits | 12 bits               |

This implementation hardcodes the machine id to `0` to test out a million unique ids being generated by a system
in almost real time using co-routines ( subjected to CPU availability ) but the machine id can be either injected from
config file or from ENV.
The seq id resets upon overflow however as the epoch is on the lhs and takes up 41 bits by the time the seq resets the
timestamp would have increased hence there won't be any duplicates. It is important to note that the seq has to be locked
either using mutex or `@Synchornized` to avoid contention and duplicate id generation by the machine.
It is important to note that while this id generated monotonically increasing unique id, but it cannot guarantee
exact monotonicity between two systems and is dependent on all the three attributes.
If you want the numbering to start from `8` so that it looks more like auto increasing number then the reserved bit 
can be set to  `1`. This code currently ignores the sign bit i.e, would be set to `0`
